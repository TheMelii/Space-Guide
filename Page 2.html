            <p>A galaxy is a huge collection of gas, dust, and billions of stars and their solar systems, all held together by gravity.
            There are more than 100 billion galaxies within our universe. Those galaxies can be one of the three kinds of galaxies: elliptical, spiral or irregular.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Spiral galaxies are twisted collections of stars and gas and are made up of hot young stars. Most spiral galaxies contain a central bulge surrounded by a flat, rotating disk of stars.
              The bulge in the center is made up of older, dimmer stars, and is thought to contain a supermassive black hole.</p>
            <p>Irregular galaxies are often chaotic in shape, with no central bulge or spiral arms. Although they used to have a more familiar shape, a dramatic collision with another galaxy has distorted their shape.</p>
            <p> Within our universe 60% of all galaxies are assumed to be either spiral or irregular.
            <br>The rest of the gelaxies are probabbly elliptical Galaxies, which are really old and rich in mass. It's speculated that the origin of a giant elliptical galaxy is from the fusion of two spiral galaxies.</p>

            <h5 class="text-center"> The sun within the Milky Way </h5>
          </div>
          <p class="text-left">The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy. It is very difficult to count the number of stars in the Milky Way from our position inside the galaxy.
            <br>Our best estimates tell us that the Milky Way is made up of approximately 100 billion stars. These stars form a large disk whose diameter is about 100,000 light years. </p>
          <p class="text-left">Our Solar System is about 25,000 light years away from the center of our galaxy – we live in the suburbs of our galaxy. Just as the Earth goes around the Sun, the Sun goes around the center of the Milky Way. It takes 230 million years for our Sun and the solar system to go all the way around the center of the Milky Way.</p>
          <p>The Milky Way does not sit still, but is constantly rotating. As such, the arms are moving through space. Our galaxy is surrounded by an enormous halo of hot gas that extends for hundreds of thousands of light-years. The gas halo is estimated to be as massive as all of the stars in the Milky Way. Like the galaxy itself, the halo is spinning rapidly.</p>
          <p>At the center of the galaxy is the galactic bulge. The heart of the Milky Way is crammed full of gas, dust, and stars. The bulge is the reason that you can only see a small percentage of the total stars in the galaxy. Dust and gas within it are so thick that you can't even peer into the bulge of the Milky Way, much less see out the other side.</p>
          <p>Tucked inside the very center of the galaxy is a monstrous black hole, billions of times as massive as the sun. This supermassive black hole may have started off smaller, but the ample supply of dust and gas allowed it to gorge itself and grow into a giant. Although black holes cannot be directly viewed, scientists can see their gravitational effects as they change and distort the paths of the material around it</p>

      <div id="Galaxy Groups">
        <h1 class="text-center"> Galaxy Groups </h1>
        <p>The Sun is captured by the Milky Way’s gravity, and the Milky Way is held together in a loose group of galaxies called the Local Group.</p>
        <p>The Local Group contains about 50 galaxies; mostly smaller dwarf galaxies. The Milky Way, Andromeda and the Triangulum Galaxy are the three large spiral galaxies in the Local Group. It contains about 1 trillion times the mass of the Sun.</p>
        <div class="text-center">
          <img style="width:60%" src="Media/Local Group.jpg">
        </div>
      </div>

      <div id="Galaxy Cluster">
        <h1 class="text-center"> Galaxy Cluster </h1>
        <p>At an even larger scale, the Local Group is part of a galaxy cluster called Virgo Cluster which contains up to 2000 galaxies. The center of the Virgo Cluster is located about 59 million light years away in the constellation of Virgo. It has a mass of about 1.5 quadrillion suns. One of the largest, brightest galaxies in the Virgo Cluster is the giant elliptical galaxy M87.</p>
        <p>And so, galaxy clusters are made up of galaxy groups. They’re large collections of thousands of galaxies held together by mutual gravitational attraction. A typical galaxy cluster contains 50 to 1000 galaxies, and has a total mass between 100 trillion and 1 quadrillion solar masses, stretching across a distance of 30 million light-years.</p>
        <p>The galaxies and galaxy groups in a galaxy cluster are buzzing around a mutual center of gravity like bees around a hive. The individual galaxies are moving too quickly to be held by the mutual gravity of just the other members in their cluster. That’s because galaxy clusters are just a part of an even larger structure called a supercluster. Superclusters really are the largest structures in the Universe, with millions of members and stretching across distances greater than 100 million light-years.</p>
