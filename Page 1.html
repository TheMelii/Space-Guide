                  <p>In the center of our solar system is the sun, it's the biggest star in our solar system. Our solar system has eight planets and those planets orbit the sun.
                  <p>The first four planets, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres and some other astronomical objects (e.g. Asteroids) build the inner Solar System, followed by the Asteroid Belt who seperates those planets from the outer solar system.
                    The last four planets, as well as other astronomical objects, build then the outer Solar System. They are followed by the Kuiper Belt in which the other known dwarf planets, including Pluto are located. </p>
                  <p>In general you can say the more distant a planet is away from sun, the longer it takes for it to orbit the sun once.</p>
                  <p>By now there have been discovered only five dwarf planets in our solar system. But assumebly there are still up to 50 other dwarf planats undiscovered in our solar system.</p>
                  <p>The major differenc between a planet and a dwarf planet is, that a dwarf planet has'nt cleared the neigborhood around its orbit, while a planet has.</p>
                  <p>Our Solar System orbits the galactical center of our galaxy-the milky way. It takes our Solar System about 230m years to orbit the center of the Milky Way once.

                  <p class="card-text">Neptune is an ice giant. Most of its mass is a hot, dense fluid of "icy" materials – water, methane and ammonia – above a small rocky core. Neptune's atmosphere is made up mostly of molecular hydrogen, atomic helium and methane.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">It was the first member of the asteroid belt to be discovered when Giuseppe Piazzi spotted it in 1801. And when Dawn arrived in 2015, Ceres became the first dwarf planet to receive a visit from a spacecraft. </p>
                    <p class="card-text">Called an asteroid for many years, Ceres is so much bigger and so different from its rocky neighbors that scientists classified it as a dwarf planet in 2006. Even though Ceres comprises 25 percent of the asteroid belt's total mass, tiny Pluto is still 14 times more massive.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">There’s no evidence of an atmosphere on Ceres, only sporadic water vapor—possibly from ice ejected by small impacts.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Scientists would like to search for possible signs of life on Ceres. It has something many other planets don't: water.Ceres is named for the Roman goddess of grain crops and harvests. The word cereal comes from the same name.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Pluto was first discovered in 1930 and considered as the ninth planet of our solar system.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">It wasn't till 2006 when pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet, as Ceres, Eris and Makemake where classified as well as dwarf planets due to their simmilar size as Pluto and their smaller sizes as the other eight planets. This action caused great controversy.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Pluto's orbit is really unusual as it is eliptical and tilted. This fact causes a huge difference in the distances from Pluto to the Sun. Pluto at perihelion (it's nearest point to the sun) is 4.44b km and Pluto at aphelion (farthest point away from the sun) is 7.38b km.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Because of dwarf planet Pluto’s elliptical orbit, Pluto is sometimes closer to the Sun (and us) than Neptune is.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Pluto has five moons in total, but the most interesting moon is called Charon and is even big enough that Pluto and Charon orbit each other.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Haumea has the fastest rotation of all equilibrium bodies in the whole solar system.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">It's high likely that Haumea lost about 20% of its mass due to a collision. This giant collision also produced Hi'iaka and Namaka the two moons of Haumea.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">This dwarf planet was discovered in 2005, but not considered a dwarf planet till 2008.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Eris first appeared to be larger than Pluto. This triggered a debate in the scientific community that led to the International Astronomical Union's decision in 2006 to clarify the definition of a planet. Pluto, Eris and other similar objects are now classified as dwarf planets.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Eris has a very small moon called Dysnomia. Dysnomia has a nearly circular orbit lasting about 16 days. Dysnomia and other small moons around planets and dwarf planets allow astronomers to calculate the mass of the parent body. Dysnomia plays a role in determining how comparable Pluto and Eris are to each other.</p>
